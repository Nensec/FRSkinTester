            This tool is made for artists to help shill their designs by making it easier to give people previews on their dragons.<br />
            Originally made for my GF so she didn't have to constantly juggle with applications to toss her creations over other people's dragons.<br />
            <br />
            I hope other artists can benefit from this too : )

        <p>
            When you upload your skin to this tool it's put into a private storage space. Nothing and no one but the website itself can access them from there.<br />
            When someone uses your preview link to show your skin on their dragon, the website generates the image by fetching the dragon image from Flight Rising and overlays your skin on top of it.<br />
            <br />
            Your skin cannot be stolen unless someone goes through the trouble of editing out their dragon from the preview image, much like if you would make a preview yourself for them.
